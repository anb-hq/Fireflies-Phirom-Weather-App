**Honorable Mention**

- This project wouldn't have been done without the guidance and the code references of fellow AnB student Mr. Moonlight, and the way he inspired me to do things like:
  - How should I organize my folder structure professionally, as doing this will help me be a better developer.
  - How should I write comments in my code.
  - How should I use certain development tools to achieve better application performance.
  - How should I structure my code, like:
    - Setting up the API.
    - Handling the API data with React state management...
  - How should I manage my project.
  - Overall, what I experienced with his work really excites me because it is something I was looking for when I joined AnB school.
- Thanks, to the other fellow AnB student as well, without their helps I definitely could not finish this project on time.
- I also owe a big shoutout to the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for the free developer subscription.
